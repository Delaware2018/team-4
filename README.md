# team-4 DOCUMENTATION

While the designs for the Student Ambassador dashboard are completed, our final product is in the MVP (most viable product) stage of development. From our understanding, your website is maintained and was developed by a freelance web developer, so the following is intended for them (or anyone else involved in the continuation of this project) to understand our decision and development process.


## DEPENDENCIES
-  axios: ^0.18.0,
- jquery: ^3.3.1,
- mdbreact: ^4.7.1,
   - react: ^16.5.2,
   - react-dom: ^16.5.2,
   - react-router: ^4.3.1,
   - react-scripts: 1.1.5


## REACT
We chose to use React due to the dashboard web application aspect of the site. We also wanted to focus on descreasing site load time and to ensure consistency across the website by using components. Due to the collaborative nature and time restraints of the hackathon, we focus primarily on inline css for certain stylistic changes, but we recommend using styled components to separate the styling with the content.


## BOOTSTRAP
We also used Bootstrap for ease of use and it's flexibility with responsive design, however, we do realize the design limitations it places. With the mockups, we wanted to inherit the current branding of Be Positive and apply it across the board. Continuing to use Bootstrap is up to your discretion.

# STRATEGY

## Project Description

Investigating into the problem space beyond the challenge statement, we found that after speaking with B+, the website was spread across various CRMs. With a priority on utilizing technology, minimizing costs, and ensuring a sustainable solution, we focused on 3 aspects of business strategy and technology: student engagement, centralizing all B+ tasks on a single site, and optimizing the donation process.

For student engagement, we developed a formalized student ambassador program (unpaid), influenced by the informal relations currently in place between student representatives and the Outreach Manager of B+. By initially attracting the interest of students through work experience with an NGO, students are able to develop a relationship and a deeper connection with B+. Student Ambassadors will report directly to their regional Project Manager, an extension to B+'s current management structure.

The motivations behind the SA program is to develop a deeper connection between students and B+, eventually leading to a network of alumni dedicated to the cause. By having strong a B+ presence on each college campus and giving students the freedom to promote advocacy and plan their own events, these experiences will be more personalized for each college culture and will be more effective in meaningful outreach. 

Utilizing technology and social media, SA's will each have accounts on the B+ website. The online dashboard will give SA's information on their school's fundraising efforts that are currently being tracked, such as top teams, top fundraising members, and current amount raised. Social media accounts are also heavily integrated into the dashboard; every new post on the B+ blog, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook will be easily accessible on the dashboard for students to share to their personal networks. To incentivize students to actively engage in the program, a badge system will allow students to collect Positive Points from their work with B+. Students can also easily leave messages for their managers in app and download resources for emailing sponsors, planning events, and presentations.

Finally, the donations page was iterated based on the need to provide more indicators of security and to emphasize recurring donations (but with user customization). Donors will also be able to create their own accounts to view analytics on their donations over time and stories of the Be Positive Heroes.
