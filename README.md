DOCUMENTATION

While the designs for the Student Ambassador dashboard are completed, our final product is in the MVP (most viable product) stage of development. From our understanding, your website is maintained and was developed by a freelance web developer, so the following is intended for them (or anyone else involved in the continuation of this project) to understand our decision and development process.


# REACT
We chose to use React due to the dashboard web application aspect of the site. We also wanted to focus on descreasing site load time and to ensure consistency across the website by using components. Due to the collaborative nature and time restraints of the hackathon, we focus primarily on inline css for certain stylistic changes, but we recommend using styled components to separate the styling with the content.


# BOOTSTRAP
We also used Bootstrap for ease of use and it's flexibility with responsive design, however, we do realize the design limitations it places. With the mockups, we wanted to inherit the current branding of Be Positive and apply it across the board. Continuing to use Bootstrap is up to your discretion.
