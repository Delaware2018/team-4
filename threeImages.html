                        <p>As a children’s cancer charity, we are proud to support cutting-edge research across the country. A few of the world-class institutions that have received our support include Seattle Children’s Hospital, Dana-Farber/Harvard Medical Center, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. The Children’s Oncology Group, the leading childhood cancer research organization in the country, has also been a beneficiary of our support. This is a time of great discovery in childhood cancer research, and we owe it to the kids to seize this opportunity.</p>
